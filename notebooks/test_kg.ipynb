These correspondences are a strong indication that there is a completeunified theory of physics, but they also suggest that it may not be possible to express this theory in a singlefundamental formulation. Instead, we may have to use different reflections of the underlying theory in differentsituations. It might be like our being unable to represent the surface of the earth on a single map and having touse different maps in different regions. This would be a revolution in our view of the unification of the laws ofscience but it would not change the most important point: that the universe is governed by a set of rational lawsthat we can discover and understand.On the observational side, by far the most important development has been the measurement of fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background radiation by COBE (the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite) and othercollaborations. These fluctuations are the finger-prints of creation, tiny initial irregularities in the otherwisesmooth and uniform early universe that later grew into galaxies, stars, and all the structures we see around us.Their form agrees with the predictions of the proposal that the universe has no boundaries or edges in theimaginary time direction; but further observations will be necessary to distinguish this proposal from otherpossible explanations for the fluctuations in the background.

The outermost sphere carried the so-called fixed stars,which always stay in the same positions relative to each other but which rotate together across the sky. Whatlay beyond the last sphere was never made very clear, but it certainly was not part of mankind’s observableuniverse.Ptolemy’s model provided a reasonably accurate system for predicting the positions of heavenly bodies in thesky. But in order to predict these positions correctly, Ptolemy had to make an assumption that the moonfollowed a path that sometimes brought it twice as close to the earth as at other times. And that meant that themoon ought sometimes to appear twice as big as at other times! Ptolemy recognized this flaw, but neverthelesshis model was generally, although not universally, accepted. It was adopted by the Christian church as thepicture of the universe that was in accordance with Scripture, for it had the great advantage that it left lots ofroom outside the sphere of fixed stars for heaven and hell.A simpler model, however, was proposed in 1514 by a Polish priest, Nicholas Copernicus. (At first, perhaps forfear of being branded a heretic by his church, Copernicus circulated his model anonymously.) His idea was thatthe sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun.Nearly a century passed before this idea was taken seriously.

This did not significantly affect their predictions of themotions of the planets, but it allowed an infinite distribution of stars to remain in equilibrium – with the attractiveforces between nearby stars balanced by the repulsive forces from those that were farther away. However, wenow believe such an equilibrium would be unstable: if the stars in some region got only slightly nearer eachother, the attractive forces between them would become stronger and dominate over the repulsive forces sothat the stars would continue to fall toward each other. On the other hand, if the stars got a bit farther awayfrom each other, the repulsive forces would dominate and drive them farther apart.Another objection to an infinite static universe is normally ascribed to the German philosopher Heinrich Olbers,who wrote about this theory in 1823. In fact, various contemporaries of Newton had raised the problem, and theOlbers article was not even the first to contain plausible arguments against it. It was, however, the first to bewidely noted. The difficulty is that in an infinite static universe nearly every line of sight would end on thesurface of a star. Thus one would expect that the whole sky would be as bright as the sun, even at night.Olbers’ counter-argument was that the light from distant stars would be dimmed by absorption by interveningmatter. However, if that happened the intervening matter would eventually heat up until it glowed as brightly asthe stars. The only way of avoiding the conclusion that the whole of the night sky should be as bright as thesurface of the sun would be to assume that the stars had not been shining forever but had turned on at somefinite time in the past. In that case the absorbing matter might not have heated up yet or the light from distantstars might not yet have reached us. And that brings us to the question of what could have caused the stars tohave turned on in the first place.The beginning of the universe had, of course, been discussed long before this. According to a number of earlycosmologies and the Jewish/Christian/Muslim tradition, the universe started at a finite, and not very distant,time in the past. One argument for such a beginning was the feeling that it was necessary to have “First Cause”to explain the existence of the universe. (Within the universe, you always explained one event as being causedby some earlier event, but the existence of the universe itself could be explained in this way only if it had somebeginning.) Another argument was put forward by St. Augustine in his book The City of God. He pointed out\\nthat civilization is progressing and we remember who performed this deed or developed that technique. Thusman, and so also perhaps the universe, could not have been around all that long. St. Augustine accepted adate of about 5000 BC for the Creation of the universe according to the book of Genesis. (It is interesting thatthis is not so far from the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 BC, which is when archaeologists tell us thatcivilization really began.)Aristotle, and most of the other Greek philosophers, on the other hand, did not like the idea of a creationbecause it smacked too much of divine intervention. They believed, therefore, that the human race and theworld around it had existed, and would exist, forever. The ancients had already considered the argument aboutprogress described above, and answered it by saying that there had been periodic floods or other disasters thatrepeatedly set the human race right back to the beginning of civilization.The questions of whether the universe had a beginning in time and whether it is limited in space were laterextensively examined by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in his monumental (and very obscure) work Critique of\\nPure Reason, published in 1781. He called these questions antinomies (that is, contradictions) of pure reason\\nbecause he felt that there were equally compelling arguments for believing the thesis, that the universe had abeginning, and the antithesis, that it had existed forever. His argument for the thesis was that if the universe didnot have a beginning, there would be an infinite period of time before any event, which he considered absurd.The argument for the antithesis was that if the universe had a beginning, there would be an infinite period oftime before it, so why should the universe begin at any one particular time? In fact, his cases for both the thesisand the antithesis are really the same argument. They are both based on his unspoken assumption that timecontinues back forever, whether or not the universe had existed forever. As we shall see, the concept of timehas no meaning before the beginning of the universe. This was first pointed out by St. Augustine. When asked:“What did God do before he created the universe?” Augustine didn’t reply: “He was preparing Hell for peoplewho asked such questions.” Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, andthat time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.When most people believed in an essentially static and unchanging universe, the question of whether or not ithad a beginning was really one of metaphysics or theology. One could account for what was observed equallywell on the theory that the universe had existed forever or on the theory that it was set in motion at some finiteA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

This discovery finally brought thequestion of the beginning of the universe into the realm of science.Hubble’s observations suggested that there was a time, called the big bang, when the universe wasinfinitesimally small and infinitely dense. Under such conditions all the laws of science, and therefore all abilityto predict the future, would break down. If there were events earlier than this time, then they could not affectwhat happens at the present time. Their existence can be ignored because it would have no observationalconsequences. One may say that time had a beginning at the big bang, in the sense that earlier times simplywould not be defined. It should be emphasized that this beginning in time is very different from those that hadbeen considered previously. In an unchanging universe a beginning in time is something that has to beimposed by some being outside the universe; there is no physical necessity for a beginning. One can imaginethat God created the universe at literally any time in the past. On the other hand, if the universe is expanding,there may be physical reasons why there had to be a beginning. One could still imagine that God created theuniverse at the instant of the big bang, or even afterwards in just such a way as to make it look as though therehad been a big bang, but it would be meaningless to suppose that it was created before the big bang. Anexpanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out hisjob!In order to talk about the nature of the universe and to discuss questions such as whether it has a beginning oran end, you have to be clear about what a scientific theory is. I shall take the simpleminded view that a theoryis just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model toobservations that we make. It exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality (whatever that mightmean). A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class ofobservations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definitepredictions about the results of future observations. For example, Aristotle believed Empedocles’s theory thateverything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water. This was simple enough, but did not makeany definite predictions. On the other hand, Newton’s theory of gravity was based on an even simpler model, inwhich bodies attracted each other with a force that was proportional to a quantity called their mass andinversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Yet it predicts the motions of the sun, themoon, and the planets to a high degree of accuracy.Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. Nomatter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the nexttime the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even asingle observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory. As philosopher of science Karl Popper hasemphasized, a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could inprinciple be disproved or falsified by observation. Each time new experiments are observed to agree with thepredictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found todisagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory.At least that is what is supposed to happen, but you can always question the competence of the person whocarried out the observation.In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory.For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motionand the predictions of Newton’s theory of gravity. Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted a slightlydifferent motion from Newton’s theory. The fact that Einstein’s predictions matched what was seen, whileNewton’s did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory. However, we still use Newton’s theoryfor all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is verysmall in the situations that we normally deal with. (Newton’s theory also has the great advantage that it is muchsimpler to work with than Einstein’s!)The eventual goal of science is to provide a single theory that describes the whole universe.

       " {'input': Document(page_content='CHAPTER 2\\nSPACE AND TIME\\n\\xa0\\nOur present ideas about the motion of bodies date back to Galileo and Newton. Before them people believedAristotle, who said that the natural state of a body was to be at rest and that it moved only if driven by a force orimpulse. It followed that a heavy body should fall faster than a light one, because it would have a greater pulltoward the earth.The Aristotelian tradition also held that one could work out all the laws that govern the universe by purethought: it was not necessary to check by observation. So no one until Galileo bothered to see whether bodiesof different weight did in fact fall at different speeds. It is said that Galileo demonstrated that Aristotle’s beliefwas false by dropping weights from the leaning tower of Pisa. The story is almost certainly untrue, but Galileodid do something equivalent: he rolled balls of different weights down a smooth slope. The situation is similar tothat of heavy bodies falling vertically, but it is easier to observe because the Speeds are smaller. Galileo’smeasurements indicated that each body increased its speed at the same rate, no matter what its weight. Forexample, if you let go of a ball on a slope that drops by one meter for every ten meters you go along, the ballwill be traveling down the slope at a speed of about one meter per second after one second, two meters persecond after two seconds, and so on, however heavy the ball. Of course a lead weight would fall faster than afeather, but that is only because a feather is slowed down by air resistance. If one drops two bodies that don’thave much air resistance, such as two different lead weights, they fall at the same rate. On the moon, wherethere is no air to slow things down, the astronaut David R. Scott performed the feather and lead weightexperiment and found that indeed they did hit the ground at the same time.Galileo’s measurements were used by Newton as the basis of his laws of motion. In Galileo’s experiments, as abody rolled down the slope it was always acted on by the same force (its weight), and the effect was to make itconstantly speed up. This showed that the real effect of a force is always to change the speed of a body, ratherthan just to set it moving, as was previously thought. It also meant that whenever a body is not acted on by anyforce, it will keep on moving in a straight line at the same speed. This idea was first stated explicitly in Newton’sPrincipia Mathematica, published in 1687, and is known as Newton’s first law. What happens to a body when a\\nforce does act on it is given by Newton’s second law. This states that the body will accelerate, or change itsspeed, at a rate that is proportional to the force. (For example, the acceleration is twice as great if the force istwice as great.) The acceleration is also smaller the greater the mass (or quantity of matter) of the body. (Thesame force acting on a body of twice the mass will produce half the acceleration.) A familiar example isprovided by a car: the more powerful the engine, the greater the acceleration, but the heavier the car, thesmaller the acceleration for the same engine. In addition to his laws of motion, Newton discovered a law todescribe the force of gravity, which states that every body attracts every other body with a force that isproportional to the mass of each body. Thus the force between two bodies would be twice as strong if one ofthe bodies (say, body A) had its mass doubled. This is what you might expect because one could think of thenew body A as being made of two bodies with the original mass. Each would attract body B with the original\\nforce. Thus the total force between A and B would be twice the original force. And if, say, one of the bodies had\\ntwice the mass, and the other had three times the mass, then the force would be six times as strong. One cannow see why all bodies fall at the same rate: a body of twice the weight will have twice the force of gravitypulling it down, but it will also have twice the mass. According to Newton’s second law, these two effects willexactly cancel each other, so the acceleration will be the same in all cases.Newton’s law of gravity also tells us that the farther apart the bodies, the smaller the force. Newton’s law ofgravity says that the gravitational attraction of a star is exactly one quarter that of a similar star at half thedistance. This law predicts the orbits of the earth, the moon, and the planets with great accuracy. If the lawwere that the gravitational attraction of a star went down faster or increased more rapidly with distance, theorbits of the planets would not be elliptical, they would either spiral in to the sun or escape from the sun.The big difference between the ideas of Aristotle and those of Galileo and Newton is that Aristotle believed in apreferred state of rest, which any body would take up if it were not driven by some force Or impulse. Inparticular, he thought that the earth was at rest. But it follows from Newton’s laws that there is no uniqueA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

In particular,as the earth was moving through the ether on its orbit round the sun, the speed of light measured in thedirection of the earth's motion through the ether (when we were moving toward the source of the light) shouldbe higher than the speed of light at right angles to that motion (when we are not moving toward the source). In1887Albert Michelson (who later became the first American to receive the Nobel Prize for physics) and EdwardMorley carried out a very careful experiment at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland. Theycompared the speed of light in the direction of the earth's motion with that at right angles to the earth's motion.To their great surprise, they found they were exactly the same!Between 1887 and 1905 there were several attempts, most notably by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, toexplain the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment in terms of objects contracting and clocks slowing downwhen they moved through the ether. However, in a famous paper in 1905, a hitherto unknown clerk in theSwiss patent office, Albert Einstein, pointed out that the whole idea of an ether was unnecessary, providing onewas willing to abandon the idea of absolute time. A similar point was made a few weeks later by a leadingFrench mathematician, Henri Poincare. Einstein’s arguments were closer to physics than those of Poincare,who regarded this problem as mathematical. Einstein is usually given the credit for the new theory, butPoincare is remembered by having his name attached to an important part of it.The fundamental postulate of the theory of relativity, as it was called, was that the laws of science should bethe same for all freely moving observers, no matter what their speed. This was true for Newton’s laws ofmotion, but now the idea was extended to include Maxwell’s theory and the speed of light: all observers shouldmeasure the same speed of light, no matter how fast they are moving. This simple idea has some remarkableconsequences. Perhaps the best known are the equivalence of mass and energy, summed up in Einstein’sfamous equation E=mc\\n2 (where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light), and the law that nothing\\nmay travel faster than the speed of light. Because of the equivalence of energy and mass, the energy which anobject has due to its motion will add to its mass. In other words, it will make it harder to increase its speed. Thiseffect is only really significant for objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light. For example, at 10percent of the speed of light an object’s mass is only 0.5 percent more than normal, while at 90 percent of thespeed of light it would be more than twice its normal mass. As an object approaches the speed of light, its massrises ever more quickly, so it takes more and more energy to speed it up further. It can in fact never reach thespeed of light, because by then its mass would have become infinite, and by the equivalence of mass andenergy, it would have taken an infinite amount of energy to get it there. For this reason, any normal object isforever confined by relativity to move at speeds slower than the speed of light. Only light, or other waves thathave no intrinsic mass, can move at the speed of light.An equally remarkable consequence of relativity is the way it has revolutionized our ideas of space and time. InNewton’s theory, if a pulse of light is sent from one place to another, different observers would agree on thetime that the journey took (since time is absolute), but will not always agree on how far the light traveled (sincespace is not absolute). Since the speed of the light is just the distance it has traveled divided by the time it hastaken, different observers would measure different speeds for the light. In relativity, on the other hand, allobservers must agree on how fast light travels. They still, however, do not agree on the distance the light has\\ntraveled, so they must therefore now also disagree over the time it has taken. (The time taken is the distancethe light has traveled – which the observers do not agree on – divided by the light’s speed – which they doagree on.) In other words, the theory of relativity put an end to the idea of absolute time! It appeared that eachobserver must have his own measure of time, as recorded by a clock carried with him, and that identical clockscarried by different observers would not necessarily agree.Each observer could use radar to say where and when an event took place by sending out a pulse of light orradio waves. Part of the pulse is reflected back at the event and the observer measures the time at which hereceives the echo. The time of the event is then said to be the time halfway between when the pulse was sentand the time when the reflection was received back: the distance of the event is half the time taken for thisround trip, multiplied by the speed of light. (An event, in this sense, is something that takes place at a singlepoint in space, at a specified point in time.)

There is no need to introduce theidea of an ether, whose presence anyway cannot be detected, as the Michelson-Morley experiment showed.The theory of relativity does, however, force us to change fundamentally our ideas of space and time. We mustaccept that time is not completely separate from and independent of space, but is combined with it to form anobject called space-time.It is a matter of common experience that one can describe the position of a point in space by three numbers, orcoordinates. For instance, one can say that a point in a room is seven feet from one wall, three feet fromanother, and five feet above the floor. Or one could specify that a point was at a certain latitude and longitudeand a certain height above sea level. One is free to use any three suitable coordinates, although they have onlya limited range of validity. One would not specify the position of the moon in terms of miles north and mileswest of Piccadilly Circus and feet above sea level. Instead, one might describe it in terms of distance from thesun, distance from the plane of the orbits of the planets, and the angle between the line joining the moon to thesun and the line joining the sun to a nearby star such as Alpha Centauri. Even these coordinates would not beof much use in describing the position of the sun in our galaxy or the position of our galaxy in the local group ofgalaxies. In fact, one may describe the whole universe in terms of a collection of overlapping patches. In eachpatch, one can use a different set of three coordinates to specify the position of a point.An event is something that happens at a particular point in space and at a particular time. So one can specify itby four numbers or coordinates. Again, the choice of coordinates is arbitrary; one can use any threewell-defined spatial coordinates and any measure of time. In relativity, there is no real distinction between thespace and time coordinates, just as there is no real difference between any two space coordinates. One couldchoose a new set of coordinates in which, say, the first space coordinate was a combination of the old first andsecond space coordinates. For instance, instead of measuring the position of a point on the earth in miles northof Piccadilly and miles west of Piccadilly, one could use miles northeast of Piccadilly, and miles north-west ofPiccadilly. Similarly, in relativity, one could use a new time coordinate that was the old time (in seconds) plusthe distance (in light-seconds) north of Piccadilly.It is often helpful to think of the four coordinates of an event as specifying its position in a four-dimensionalspace called space-time. It is impossible to imagine a four-dimensional space. I personally find it hard enoughto visualize three-dimensional space! However, it is easy to draw diagrams of two-dimensional spaces, such asthe surface of the earth. (The surface of the earth is two-dimensional because the position of a point can bespecified by two coordinates, latitude and longitude.) I shall generally use diagrams in which time increasesupward and one of the spatial dimensions is shown horizontally. The other two spatial dimensions are ignoredor, sometimes, one of them is indicated by perspective.

The paths of the sun and of Alpha Centauri throughspace-time are shown as the vertical lines on the left and right of the diagram. A ray of light from the sunfollows the diagonal line, and takes four years to get from the sun to Alpha Centauri.As we have seen, Maxwell’s equations predicted that the speed of light should be the same whatever thespeed of the source, and this has been confirmed by accurate measurements. It follows from this that if a pulseof light is emitted at a particular time at a particular point in space, then as time goes on it will spread out as asphere of light whose size and position are independent of the speed of the source. After one millionth of asecond the light will have spread out to form a sphere with a radius of 300 meters; after two millionths of asecond, the radius will be 600 meters; and so on. It will be like the ripples that spread out on the surface of apond when a stone is thrown in. The ripples spread out as a circle that gets bigger as time goes on. If onestacks snapshots of the ripples at different times one above the other, the expanding circle of ripples will markout a cone whose tip is at the place and time at which the stone hit the water Figure 2:3 .A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

Only thenwould events on earth lie in the future light cone of the event at which the sun went out. Similarly, we do notknow what is happening at the moment farther away in the universe: the light that we see from distant galaxiesleft them millions of years ago, and in the case of the most distant object that we have seen, the light left someeight thousand million years ago. Thus, when we look at the universe, we are seeing it as it was in the past.If one neglects gravitational effects, as Einstein and Poincare did in 1905, one has what is called the specialtheory of relativity. For every event in space-time we may construct a light cone (the set of all possible paths oflight in space-time emitted at that event), and since the speed of light is the same at every event and in everydirection, all the light cones will be identical and will all point in the same direction. The theory also tells us thatnothing can travel faster than light. This means that the path of any object through space and time must berepresented by a line that lies within the light cone at each event on it (Fig. 2.7). The special theory of relativitywas very successful in explaining that the speed of light appears the same to all observers (as shown by theMichelson-Morley experiment) and in describing what happens when things move at speeds close to the speedof light. However, it was inconsistent with the Newtonian theory of gravity, which said that objects attractedeach other with a force that depended on the distance between them. This meant that if one moved one of theobjects, the force on the other one would change instantaneously. Or in other gravitational effects should travelwith infinite velocity, instead of at or below the speed of light, as the special theory of relativity required.Einstein made a number of unsuccessful attempts between 1908 and 1914 to find a theory of gravity that wasconsistent with special relativity. Finally, in 1915, he proposed what we now call the general theory of relativity.Einstein made the revolutionary suggestion that gravity is not a force like other forces, but is a consequence ofthe fact that space-time is not flat, as had been previously assumed: it is curved, or “warped,” by the distributionA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

This is known as the twins paradox, but it is a paradox only ifone has the idea of absolute time at the back of one’s mind. In the theory of relativity there is no uniqueabsolute time, but instead each individual has his own personal measure of time that depends on where he isand how he is moving.Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was notaffected by what happened in it. This was true even of the special theory of relativity. Bodies moved, forcesattracted and repelled, but time and space simply continued, unaffected. It was natural to think that space andtime went on forever.The situation, however, is quite different in the general theory of relativity. Space and time are now dynamicquantities: when a body moves, or a force acts, it affects the curvature of space and time – and in turn thestructure of space-time affects the way in which bodies move and forces act. Space and time not only affect butalso are affected by everything that happens in the universe. Just as one cannot talk about events in theuniverse without the notions of space and time, so in general relativity it became meaningless to talk aboutspace and time outside the limits of the universe.In the following decades this new understanding of space and time was to revolutionize our view of theuniverse. The old idea of an essentially unchanging universe that could have existed, and could continue toexist, forever was replaced by the notion of a dynamic, expanding universe that seemed to have begun a finitetime ago, and that might end at a finite time in the future. That revolution forms the subject of the next chapter.And years later, it was also to be the starting point for my work in theoretical physics.

There will also be a very large number of stars, which are just like our ownsun but much farther from us. Some of these fixed stars do, in fact, appear to change very slightly theirpositions relative to each other as earth orbits around the sun: they are not really fixed at all! This is becausethey are comparatively near to us. As the earth goes round the sun, we see them from different positionsagainst the background of more distant stars. This is fortunate, because it enables us to measure directly thedistance of these stars from us: the nearer they are, the more they appear to move. The nearest star, calledProxima Centauri, is found to be about four light-years away (the light from it takes about four years to reachearth), or about twenty-three million million miles. Most of the other stars that are visible to the naked eye liewithin a few hundred light-years of us. Our sun, for comparison, is a mere light-minutes away! The visible starsappear spread all over the night sky, but are particularly concentrated in one band, which we call the MilkyWay. As long ago as 1750, some astronomers were suggesting that the appearance of the Milky Way could beexplained if most of the visible stars lie in a single disklike configuration, one example of what we now call aspiral galaxy. Only a few decades later, the astronomer Sir William Herschel confirmed this idea bypainstakingly cataloging the positions and distances of vast numbers of stars. Even so, the idea gainedcomplete acceptance only early this century.Our modern picture of the universe dates back to only 1924, when the American astronomer Edwin Hubbledemonstrated that ours was not the only galaxy. There were in fact many others, with vast tracts of emptyspace between them. In order to prove this, he needed to determine the distances to these other galaxies,which are so far away that, unlike nearby stars, they really do appear fixed. Hubble was forced, therefore, touse indirect methods to measure the distances. Now, the apparent brightness of a star depends on two factors:how much light it radiates (its luminosity), and how far it is from us. For nearby stars, we can measure theirapparent brightness and their distance, and so we can work out their luminosity. Conversely, if we knew theluminosity of stars in other galaxies, we could work out their distance by measuring their apparent brightness.Hubble noted that certain types of stars always have the same luminosity when they are near enough for us tomeasure; therefore, he argued, if we found such stars in another galaxy, we could assume that they had thesame luminosity – and so calculate the distance to that galaxy. If we could do this for a number of stars in thesame galaxy, and our calculations always gave the same distance, we could be fairly confident of our estimate.In this way, Edwin Hubble worked out the distances to nine different galaxies. We now know that our galaxy isonly one of some hundred thousand million that can be seen using modern telescopes, each galaxy itselfcontaining some hundred thousand million stars. Figure 3:1  shows a picture of one spiral galaxy that is similar\\nto what we think ours must look like to someone living in another galaxy.A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

Our sun is just an ordinary,average-sized, yellow star, near the inner edge of one of the spiral arms. We have certainly come a long waysince Aristotle and Ptolemy, when thought that the earth was the center of the universe!Stars are so far away that they appear to us to be just pinpoints of light. We cannot see their size or shape. Sohow can we tell different types of stars apart? For the vast majority of stars, there is only one characteristicfeature that we can observe – the color of their light. Newton discovered that if light from the sun passesthrough a triangular-shaped piece of glass, called a prism, it breaks up into its component colors (its spectrum)as in a rainbow. By focusing a telescope on an individual star or galaxy, one can similarly observe the spectrumof the light from that star or galaxy. Different stars have different spectra, but the relative brightness of thedifferent colors is always exactly what one would expect to find in the light emitted by an object that is glowingred hot. (In fact, the light emitted by any opaque object that is glowing red hot has a characteristic spectrumthat depends only on its temperature – a thermal spectrum. This means that we can tell a star’s temperaturefrom the spectrum of its light.) Moreover, we find that certain very specific colors are missing from stars’spectra, and these missing colors may vary from star to star. Since we know that each chemical elementabsorbs a characteristic set of very specific colors, by matching these to those that are missing from a star’sspectrum, we can determine exactly which elements are present in the star’s atmosphere.In the 1920s, when astronomers began to look at the spectra of stars in other galaxies, they found somethingmost peculiar: there were the same characteristic sets of missing colors as for stars in our own galaxy, but theywere all shifted by the same relative amount toward the red end of the spectrum. To understand theimplications of this, we must first understand the Doppler effect. As we have seen, visible light consists offluctuations, or waves, in the electromagnetic field. The wavelength (or distance from one wave crest to thenext) of light is extremely small, ranging from four to seven ten-millionths of a meter. The different wavelengthsof light are what the human eye sees as different colors, with the longest wavelengths appearing at the red endof the spectrum and the shortest wavelengths at the blue end. Now imagine a source of light at a constantdistance from us, such as a star, emitting waves of light at a constant wavelength. Obviously the wavelength ofA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

Suppose now that the source starts moving towardus. When the source emits the next wave crest it will be nearer to us, so the distance between wave crests willbe smaller than when the star was stationary. This means that the wavelength of the waves we receive isshorter than when the star was stationary. Correspondingly, if the source is moving away from us, thewavelength of the waves we receive will be longer. In the case of light, therefore, means that stars movingaway from us will have their spectra shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (red-shifted) and those movingtoward us will have their spectra blue-shifted. This relationship between wavelength and speed, which is calledthe Doppler effect, is an everyday experience. Listen to a car passing on the road: as the car is approaching, itsengine sounds at a higher pitch (corresponding to a shorter wavelength and higher frequency of sound waves),and when it passes and goes away, it sounds at a lower pitch. The behavior of light or radio waves is similar.Indeed, the police make use of the Doppler effect to measure the speed of cars by measuring the wavelengthof pulses of radio waves reflected off them.ln the years following his proof of the existence of other galaxies, Rubble spent his time cataloging theirdistances and observing their spectra. At that time most people expected the galaxies to be moving aroundquite randomly, and so expected to find as many blue-shifted spectra as red-shifted ones. It was quite asurprise, therefore, to find that most galaxies appeared red-shifted: nearly all were moving away from us! Moresurprising still was the finding that Hubble published in 19 29: even the size of a galaxy’s red shift is not random,\\nbut is directly proportional to the galaxy’s distance from us. Or, in other words, the farther a galaxy is, the fasterit is moving away! And that meant that the universe could not be static, as everyone previously had thought, isin fact expanding; the distance between the different galaxies is changing all the time.The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the twentiethcentury. With hindsight, it is easy wonder why no one had thought of it before. Newton, and others should haverealized that a static universe would soon start to contract under the influence of gravity. But suppose insteadthat the universe is expanding. If it was expanding fairly slowly, the force of gravity would cause it eventually tostop expanding and then to start contracting. However, if it was expanding at more than a certain critical rate,gravity would never be strong enough to stop it, and the universe would continue to expand forever. This is a bitlike what happens when one fires a rocket upward from the surface of the earth. If it has a fairly low speed,gravity will eventually stop the rocket and it will start falling back. On the other hand, if the rocket has more thana certain critical speed (about seven miles per second), gravity will not be strong enough to pull it back, so it willkeep going away from the earth forever. This behavior of the universe could have been predicted fromNewton’s theory of gravity at any time in the nineteenth, the eighteenth, or even the late seventeenth century.Yet so strong was the belief in a static universe that it persisted into the early twentieth century. Even Einstein,when he formulated the general theory of relativity in 1915, was so sure that the universe had to be static thathe modified his theory to make this possible, introducing a so-called cosmological constant into his equations.Einstein introduced a new “antigravity” force, which, unlike other forces, did not come from any particularsource but was built into the very fabric of space-time. He claimed that space-time had an inbuilt tendency toexpand, and this could be made to balance exactly the attraction of all the matter in the universe, so that astatic universe would result. Only one man, it seems, was willing to take general relativity at face value, andwhile Einstein and other physicists were looking for ways of avoiding general relativity’s prediction of anonstatic universe, the Russian physicist and mathematician Alexander Friedmann instead set about explainingit.Friedmann made two very simple assumptions about the universe: that the universe looks identical inwhichever direction we look, and that this would also be true if we were observing the universe from anywhereelse. From these two ideas alone, Friedmann showed that we should not expect the universe to be static. Infact, in 1922, several years before Edwin Hubble’s discovery, Friedmann predicted exactly what Hubble found!The assumption that the universe looks the same in every direction is clearly not true in reality. For example, aswe have seen, the other stars in our galaxy form a distinct band of light across the night sky, called the MilkyWay. But if we look at distant galaxies, there seems to be more or less the same number of them. So theuniverse does seem to be roughly the same in every direction, provided one views it on a large scale comparedto the distance between galaxies, and ignores the differences on small scales. For a long time, this wassufficient justification for Friedmann’s assumption – as a rough approximation to the real universe. But morerecently a lucky accident uncovered the fact that Friedmann’s assumption is in fact a remarkably accurateA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

(Microwaves are just like light waves, but with awavelength of around a centimeter.) Penzias and Wilson were worried when they found that their detector waspicking up more noise than it ought to. The noise did not appear to be coming from any particular direction.First they discovered bird droppings in their detector and checked for other possible malfunctions, but soonruled these out. They knew that any noise from within the atmosphere would be stronger when the detectorwas not pointing straight up than when it was, because light rays travel through much more atmosphere whenreceived from near the horizon than when received from directly overhead. The extra noise was the samewhichever direction the detector was pointed, so it must come from outside the atmosphere. It was also the\\nsame day and night and throughout the year, even though the earth was rotating on its axis and orbiting aroundthe sun. This showed that the radiation must come from beyond the Solar System, and even from beyond thegalaxy, as otherwise it would vary as the movement of earth pointed the detector in different directions.In fact, we know that the radiation must have traveled to us across most of the observable universe, and sinceit appears to be the same in different directions, the universe must also be the same in every direction, if onlyon a large scale. We now know that whichever direction we look, this noise never varies by more than a tinyfraction: so Penzias and Wilson had unwittingly stumbled across a remarkably accurate confirmation ofFriedmann’s first assumption. However, because the universe is not exactly the same in every direction, butonly on average on a large scale, the microwaves cannot be exactly the same in every direction either. Therehave to be slight variations between different directions. These were first detected in 1992 by the CosmicBackground Explorer satellite, or COBE, at a level of about one part in a hundred thousand. Small though thesevariations are, they are very important, as will be explained in Chapter 8.At roughly the same time as Penzias and Wilson were investigating noise in their detector, two Americanphysicists at nearby Princeton University, Bob Dicke and Jim Peebles, were also taking an interest inmicrowaves. They were working on a suggestion, made by George Gamow (once a student of AlexanderFriedmann), that the early universe should have been very hot and dense, glowing white hot. Dicke andPeebles argued that we should still be able to see the glow of the early universe, because light from verydistant parts of it would only just be reaching us now. However, the expansion of the universe meant that thislight should be so greatly red-shifted that it would appear to us now as microwave radiation. Dicke and Peebleswere preparing to look for this radiation when Penzias and Wilson heard about their work and realized that theyhad already found it. For this, Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978 (which seems a bithard on Dicke and Peebles, not to mention Gamow!).Now at first sight, all this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seemto suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if weobserve all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe. There is,however, an alternate explanation: the universe might look the same in every direction as seen from any othergalaxy too. This, as we have seen, was Friedmann’s second assumption. We have no scientific evidence for, oragainst, this assumption. We believe it only on grounds of modesty: it would be most remarkable if the universelooked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe! In Friedmann’smodel, all the galaxies are moving directly away from each other. The situation is rather like a balloon with anumber of spots painted on it being steadily blown up. As the balloon expands, the distance between any twospots increases, but there is no spot that can be said to be the center of the expansion. Moreover, the fartherapart the spots are, the faster they will be moving apart. Similarly, in Friedmann’s model the speed at which anytwo galaxies are moving apart is proportional to the distance between them. So it predicted that the red shift ofa galaxy should be directly proportional to its distance from us, exactly as Hubble found. Despite the success ofhis model and his prediction of Hubble’s observations, Friedmann’s work remained largely unknown in the Westuntil similar models were discovered in 1935 by the American physicist Howard Robertson and the Britishmathematician Arthur Walker, in response to Hubble’s discovery of the uniform expansion of the universe.Although Friedmann found only one, there are in fact three different kinds of models that obey Friedmann’s twofundamental assumptions. In the first kind (which Friedmann found) the universe is expanding sufficientlyslowly that the gravitational attraction between the different galaxies causes the expansion to slow down andeventually to stop. The galaxies then start to move toward each other and the universe contracts.A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

       " {'input': Document(page_content='the stars that we can see in our galaxy and other galaxies, the total is less than one hundredth of the amountrequired to halt the expansion of the universe, even for the lowest estimate of the rate of expansion. Our galaxyand other galaxies, however, must contain a large amount of “dark matter” that we cannot see directly, butwhich we know must be there because of the influence of its gravitational attraction on the orbits of stars in thegalaxies. Moreover, most galaxies are found in clusters, and we can similarly infer the presence of yet moredark matter in between the galaxies in these clusters by its effect on the motion of the galaxies. When we addup all this dark matter, we still get only about one tenth of the amount required to halt the expansion. However,we cannot exclude the possibility that there might be some other form of matter, distributed almost uniformlythroughout the universe, that we have not yet detected and that might still raise the average density of theuniverse up to the critical value needed to halt the expansion. The present evidence therefore suggests that theuniverse will probably expand forever, but all we can really be sure of is that even if the universe is going torecollapse, it won’t do so for at least another ten thousand million years, since it has already been expandingfor at least that long. This should not unduly worry us: by that time, unless we have colonized beyond the SolarSystem, mankind will long since have died out, extinguished along with our sun!All of the Friedmann solutions have the feature that at some time in the past (between ten and twenty thousandmillion years ago) the distance between neighboring galaxies must have been zero. At that time, which we callthe big bang, the density of the universe and the curvature of space-time would have been infinite. Becausemathematics cannot really handle infinite numbers, this means that the general theory of relativity (on whichFriedmann’s solutions are based) predicts that there is a point in the universe where the theory itself breaksdown. Such a point is an example of what mathematicians call a singularity. In fact, all our theories of scienceare formulated on the assumption that space-time is smooth and nearly fiat, so they break down at the big bangsingularity, where the curvature of space-time is infinite. This means that even if there were events before thebig bang, one could not use them to determine what would happen afterward, because predictability wouldbreak down at the big bang.Correspondingly, if, as is the case, we know only what has happened since the big bang, we could notdetermine what happened beforehand. As far as we are concerned, events before the big bang can have noconsequences, so they should not form part of a scientific model of the universe. We should therefore cut themout of the model and say that time had a beginning at the big bang.Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention.(The Catholic Church, on the other hand, seized on the big bang model and in 1951officially pronounced it tobe in accordance with the Bible.) There were therefore a number of attempts to avoid the conclusion that therehad been a big bang. The proposal that gained widest support was called the steady state theory. It wassuggested in 1948 by two refugees from Nazi-occupied Austria, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, togetherwith a Briton, Fred Hoyle, who had worked with them on the development of radar during the war. The idea wasthat as the galaxies moved away from each other, new galaxies were continually forming in the gaps inbetween, from new matter that was being continually created. The universe would therefore look roughly thesame at all times as well as at all points of space. The steady state theory required a modification of generalrelativity to allow for the continual creation of matter, but the rate that was involved was so low (about oneparticle per cubic kilometer per year) that it was not in conflict with experiment. The theory was a good scientifictheory, in the sense described in Chapter 1: it was simple and it made definite predictions that could be testedby observation. One of these predictions was that the number of galaxies or similar objects in any given volumeof space should be the same wherever and whenever we look in the universe. In the late 1950s and early1960s a survey of sources of radio waves from outer space was carried out at Cambridge by a group ofastronomers led by Martin Ryle (who had also worked with Bondi, Gold, and Hoyle on radar during the war).The Cambridge group showed that most of these radio sources must lie outside our galaxy (indeed many ofthem could be identified with other galaxies) and also that there were many more weak sources than strongones. They interpreted the weak sources as being the more distant ones, and the stronger ones as beingnearer. Then there appeared to be less common sources per unit volume of space for the nearby sources thanfor the distant ones. This could mean that we are at the center of a great region in the universe in which thesources are fewer than elsewhere. Alternatively, it could mean that the sources were more numerous in thepast, at the time that the radio waves left on their journey to us, than they are now. Either explanationcontradicted the predictions of the steady state theory. Moreover, the discovery of the microwave radiation byPenzias and Wilson in 1965 also indicated that the universe must have been much denser in the past. Thesteady state theory therefore had to be abandoned.A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

       " {'input': Document(page_content='Another attempt to avoid the conclusion that there must have been a big bang, and therefore a beginning oftime, was made by two Russian scientists, Evgenii Lifshitz and Isaac Khalatnikov, in 1963. They suggested thatthe big bang might be a peculiarity of Friedmann’s models alone, which after all were only approximations tothe real universe. Perhaps, of all the models that were roughly like the real universe, only Friedmann’s wouldcontain a big bang singularity. In Friedmann’s models, the galaxies are all moving directly away from eachother – so it is not surprising that at some time in the past they were all at the same\\xa0 place. In the real universe,however, the galaxies are not just moving directly away from each other – they also have small sidewaysvelocities. So in reality they need never have been all at exactly the same place, only very close together.Perhaps then the current expanding universe resulted not from a big bang singularity, but from an earliercontracting phase; as the universe had collapsed the particles in it might not have all collided, but had flownpast and then away from each other, producing the present expansion of the the universe that were roughly likeFriedmann’s models but took account of the irregularities and random velocities of galaxies in the real universe.They showed that such models could start with a big bang, even though the galaxies were no longer alwaysmoving directly away from each other, but they claimed that this was still only possible in certain exceptionalmodels in which the galaxies were all moving in just the right way. They argued that since there seemed to beinfinitely more Friedmann-like models without a big bang singularity than there were with one, we shouldconclude that there had not in reality been a big bang. They later realized, however, that there was a muchmore general class of Friedmann-like models that did have singularities, and in which the galaxies did not haveto be moving any special way. They therefore withdrew their claim in 1970.The work of Lifshitz and Khalatnikov was valuable because it showed that the universe could have had a\\nsingularity, a big bang, if the general theory of relativity was correct. However, it did not resolve the crucialquestion: Does general relativity predict that our universe should have had a big bang, a beginning of time?\\nThe answer to this carne out of a completely different approach introduced by a British mathematician andphysicist, Roger Penrose, in 1965. Using the way light cones behave in general relativity, together with the factthat gravity is always attractive, he showed that a star collapsing under its own gravity is trapped in a regionwhose surface eventually shrinks to zero size. And, since the surface of the region shrinks to zero, so too mustits volume. All the matter in the star will be compressed into a region of zero volume, so the density of matterand the curvature of space-time become infinite. In other words, one has a singularity contained within a regionof space-time known as a black hole.At first sight, Penrose’s result applied only to stars; it didn’t have anything to say about the question of whetherthe entire universe had a big bang singularity in its past. However, at the time that Penrose produced histheorem, I was a research student desperately looking for a problem with which to complete my Ph.D. thesis.Two years before, I had been diagnosed as suffering from ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, ormotor neuron disease, and given to understand that I had only one or two more years to live. In thesecircumstances there had not seemed much point in working on my Ph.D.– I did not expect to survive that long.Yet two years had gone by and I was not that much worse. In fact, things were going rather well for me and Ihad gotten engaged to a very nice girl, Jane Wilde. But in order to get married, I needed a job, and in order toget a job, I needed a Ph.D.In 1965 I read about Penrose’s theorem that any body undergoing gravitational collapse must eventually form asingularity. I soon realized that if one reversed the direction of time in Penrose’s theorem, so that the collapsebecame an expansion, the conditions of his theorem would still hold, provided the universe were roughly like aFriedmann model on large scales at the present time. Penrose’s theorem had shown that any collapsing starmust end in a singularity; the time-reversed argument showed that any Friedmann-like expanding universe\\nmust have begun with a singularity. For technical reasons, Penrose’s theorem required that the universe be\\ninfinite in space. So I could in fact, use it to prove that there should be a singularity only if the universe wasexpanding fast enough to avoid collapsing again (since only those Friedmann models were infinite in space).During the next few years I developed new mathematical techniques to remove this and other technicalconditions from the theorems that proved that singularities must occur. The final result was a joint paper byPenrose and myself in 1970, which at last proved that there must have been a big bang singularity providedonly that general relativity is correct and the universe contains as much matter as we observe. There was a lotof opposition to our work, partly from the Russians because of their Marxist belief in scientific determinism, andpartly from people who felt that the whole idea of singularities was repugnant and spoiled the beauty ofEinstein’s theory.

It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists thatthere was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe – as we shall see later, it can disappear oncequantum effects are taken into account.We have seen in this chapter how, in less than half a century, man’s view of the universe formed over millenniahas been transformed. Hubble’s discovery that the universe was expanding, and the realization of theinsignificance of our own planet in the vastness of the universe, were just the starting point. As experimentaland theoretical evidence mounted, it became more and more clear that the universe must have had abeginning in time, until in 1970 this was finally proved by Penrose and myself, on the basis of Einstein’s generaltheory of relativity. That proof showed that general relativity is only an incomplete theory: it cannot tell us howthe universe started off, because it predicts that all physical theories, including itself, break down at thebeginning of the universe. However, general relativity claims to be only a partial theory, so what the singularitytheorems really show is that there must have been a time in the very early universe when the universe was sosmall that one could no longer ignore the small-scale effects of the other great partial theory of the twentiethcentury, quantum mechanics.

       " {'input': Document(page_content='CHAPTER 4\\nTHE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE\\n\\xa0\\nThe success of scientific theories, particularly Newton’s theory of gravity, led the French scientist the Marquis de Laplaceat the beginning of the nineteenth century to argue that the universe was completely deterministic. Laplace suggestedthat there should be a set of scientific laws that would allow us to predict everything that would happen in the universe, ifonly we knew the complete state of the universe at one time. For example, if we knew the positions and speeds of thesun and the planets at one time, then we could use Newton’s laws to calculate the state of the Solar System at any othertime. Determinism seems fairly obvious in this case, but Laplace went further to assume that there were similar lawsgoverning everything else, including human behavior.The doctrine of scientific determinism was strongly resisted by many people, who felt that it infringed God’s freedom tointervene in the world, but it remained the standard assumption of science until the early years of this century. One of thefirst indications that this belief would have to be abandoned came when calculations by the British scientists LordRayleigh and Sir James Jeans suggested that a hot object, or body, such as a star, must radiate energy at an infiniterate. According to the laws we believed at the time, a hot body ought to give off electromagnetic waves (such as radiowaves, visible light, or X rays) equally at all frequencies. For example, a hot body should radiate the same amount ofenergy in waves with frequencies between one and two million million waves a second as in waves with frequenciesbetween two and three million million waves a second. Now since the number of waves a second is unlimited, this wouldmean that the total energy radiated would be infinite.In order to avoid this obviously ridiculous result, the German scientist Max Planck suggested in 1900 that light, X rays,and other waves could not be emitted at an arbitrary rate, but only in certain packets that he called quanta. Moreover,each quantum had a certain amount of energy that was greater the higher the frequency of the waves, so at a highenough frequency the emission of a single quantum would require more energy than was available. Thus the radiation athigh frequencies would be reduced, and so the rate at which the body lost energy would be finite.The quantum hypothesis explained the observed rate of emission of radiation from hot bodies very well, but itsimplications for determinism were not realized until 1926, when another German scientist, Werner Heisenberg,formulated his famous uncertainty principle. In order to predict the future position and velocity of a particle, one has to beable to measure its present position and velocity accurately. The obvious way to do this is to shine light on the particle.Some of the waves of light will be scattered by the particle and this will indicate its position. However, one will not be ableto determine the position of the particle more accurately than the distance between the wave crests of light, so one needsto use light of a short wavelength in order to measure the position of the particle precisely. Now, by Planck’s quantumhypothesis, one cannot use an arbitrarily small amount of light; one has to use at least one quantum. This quantum willdisturb the particle and change its velocity in a way that cannot be predicted. moreover, the more accurately onemeasures the position, the shorter the wavelength of the light that one needs and hence the higher the energy of a singlequantum. So the velocity of the particle will be disturbed by a larger amount. In other words, the more accurately you tryto measure the position of the particle, the less accurately you can measure its speed, and vice versa. Heisenbergshowed that the uncertainty in the position of the particle times the uncertainty in its velocity times the mass of theparticle can never be smaller than a certain quantity, which is known as Planck’s constant. Moreover, this limit does notdepend on the way in which one tries to measure the position or velocity of the particle, or on the type of particle:Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is a fundamental, inescapable property of the world.The uncertainty principle had profound implications for the way in which we view the world. Even after more than seventyyears they have not been fully appreciated by many philosophers, and are still the subject of much controversy. Theuncertainty principle signaled an end to Laplace’s dream of a theory of science, a model of the universe that would becompletely deterministic: one certainly cannot predict future events exactly if one cannot even measure the present stateof the universe precisely! We could still imagine that there is a set of laws that determine events completely for somesupernatural being, who could observe the present state of the universe without disturbing it. However, such models ofthe universe are not of much interest to us ordinary mortals. It seems better to employ the principle of economy known asOccam’s razor and cut out all the features of the theory that cannot be observed. This approach led Heisenberg, ErwinSchrodinger, and Paul Dirac in the 1920s to reformulate mechanics into a new theory called quantum mechanics, basedon the uncertainty principle. In this theory particles no longer had separate, well-defined positions and velocities thatcould not be observed, Instead, they had a quantum state, which was a combination of position and velocity.In general, quantum mechanics does not predict a single definite result for an observation. Instead, it predicts a numberof different possible outcomes and tells us how likely each of these is. That is to say, if one made the same measurementon a large number of similar systems, each of which started off in the same way, one would find that the result of theA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

On one side of the partition one places a source of fight of aparticular color (that is, of a particular wavelength). Most of the light will hit the partition, but a small amount will gothrough the slits. Now suppose one places a screen on the far side of the partition from the light. Any point on the screenwill receive waves from the two slits. However, in general, the distance the light has to travel from the source to thescreen via the two slits will be different. This will mean that the waves from the slits will not be in phase with each otherwhen they arrive at the screen: in some places the waves will cancel each other out, and in others they will reinforceeach other. The result is a characteristic pattern of light and dark fringes.The remarkable thing is that one gets exactly the same kind of fringes if one replaces the source of light by a source ofparticles such as electrons with a definite speed (this means that the corresponding waves have a definite length). Itseems the more peculiar because if one only has one slit, one does not get any fringes, just a uniform distribution ofelectrons across the screen. One might therefore think that opening another slit would just increase the number ofelectrons hitting each point of the screen, but, because of interference, it actually decreases it in some places. Ifelectrons are sent through the slits one at a time, one would expect each to pass through one slit or the other, and sobehave just as if the slit it passed through were the only one there – giving a uniform distribution on the screen.

This division of the contents of the universe into matter and forces is still used today. Aristotlebelieved that matter was continuous, that is, one could divide a piece of matter into smaller and smaller bits without anylimit: one never came up against a grain of matter that could not be divided further. A few Greeks, however, such asDemocritus, held that matter was inherently grainy and that everything was made up of large numbers of various differentkinds of atoms. (The word atom means “indivisible” in Greek.) For centuries the argument continued without any real\\nevidence on either side, but in 1803 the British chemist and physicist John Dalton pointed out that the fact that chemicalcompounds always combined in certain proportions could be explained by the grouping together of atoms to form unitscalled molecules. However, the argument between the two schools of thought was not finally settled in favor of theatomists until the early years of this century. One of the important pieces of physical evidence was provided by Einstein.In a paper written in 1905, a few weeks before the famous paper on special relativity, Einstein pointed out that what wascalled Brownian motion – the irregular, random motion of small particles of dust suspended in a liquid – could beexplained as the effect of atoms of the liquid colliding with the dust particles.By this time there were already suspicions that these atoms were not, after all, indivisible. Several years previously afellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, J. J. Thomson, had demonstrated the existence of a particle of matter, called theelectron, that had a mass less than one thousandth of that of the lightest atom. He used a setup rather like a modern TVpicture tube: a red-hot metal filament gave off the electrons, and because these have a negative electric charge, anelectric field could be used to accelerate them toward a phosphor-coated screen. When they hit the screen, flashes oflight were generated. Soon it was realized that these electrons must be coming from within the atoms themselves, and in1911 the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford finally showed that the atoms of matter do have internal structure:they are made up of an extremely tiny, positively charged nucleus, around which a number of electrons orbit. He deducedthis by analyzing the way in which alpha-particles, which are positively charged particles given off by radioactive atoms,are deflected when they collide with atoms.At first it was thought that the nucleus of the atom was made up of electrons and different numbers of a positivelycharged particle called the proton, from the Greek word meaning “first,” because it was believed to be the fundamentalunit from which matter was made. However, in 1932 a colleague of Rutherford’s at Cambridge, James Chadwick,discovered that the nucleus contained another particle, called the neutron, which had almost the same mass as a protonbut no electrical charge. Chadwick received the Nobel Prize for his discovery, and was elected Master of Gonville andCaius College, Cambridge (the college of which I am now a fellow). He later resigned as Master because ofdisagreements with the Fellows. There had been a bitter dispute in the college ever since a group of young Fellowsreturning after the war had voted many of the old Fellows out of the college offices they had held for a long time. Thiswas before my time; I joined the college in 1965 at the tail end of the bitterness, when similar disagreements forcedanother Nobel Prize – winning Master, Sir Nevill Mott, to resign.Up to about thirty years ago, it was thought that protons and neutrons were “elementary” particles, but experiments inwhich protons were collided with other protons or electrons at high speeds indicated that they were in fact made up ofsmaller particles. These particles were named quarks by the Caltech physicist Murray Gell-Mann, who won the NobelPrize in 1969 for his work on them. The origin of the name is an enigmatic quotation from James Joyce: “Three quarks forMuster Mark!” The word quark is supposed to be pronounced like quart, but with a k at the end instead of a t, but is\\nusually pronounced to rhyme with lark.\\nThere are a number of different varieties of quarks: there are six “flavors,” which we call up, down, strange, charmed,bottom, and top. The first three flavors had been known since the 1960s but the charmed quark was discovered only in1974, the bottom in 1977, and the top in 1995. Each flavor comes in three “colors,” red, green, and blue. (It should beemphasized that these terms are just labels: quarks are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light and so do nothave any color in the normal sense. It is just that modern physicists seem to have more imaginative ways of naming newparticles and phenomena – they no longer restrict themselves to Greek!) A proton or neutron is made up of three quarks,one of each color. A proton contains two up quarks and one down quark; a neutron contains two down and one up. Wecan create particles made up of the other quarks (strange, charmed, bottom, and top), but these all have a much greatermass and decay very rapidly into protons and neutrons.We now know that neither the atoms nor the protons and neutrons within them are indivisible. So the question is: whatare the truly elementary particles, the basic building blocks from which everything is made? Since the wavelength of lightA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

We need touse something with a much smaller wave-length. As we saw in the last chapter, quantum mechanics tells us that allparticles are in fact waves, and that the higher the energy of a particle, the smaller the wavelength of the correspondingwave. So the best answer we can give to our question depends on how high a particle energy we have at our disposal,because this determines on how small a length scale we can look. These particle energies are usually measured in unitscalled electron volts. (In Thomson’s experiments with electrons, we saw that he used an electric field to accelerate theelectrons. The energy that an electron gains from an electric field of one volt is what is known as an electron volt.) In thenineteenth century, when the only particle energies that people knew how to use were the low energies of a few electronvolts generated by chemical reactions such as burning, it was thought that atoms were the smallest unit. In Rutherford’sexperiment, the alpha-particles had energies of millions of electron volts. More recently, we have learned how to useelectromagnetic fields to give particles energies of at first millions and then thousands of millions of electron volts. And sowe know that particles that were thought to be “elementary” thirty years ago are, in fact, made up of smaller particles.May these, as we go to still higher energies, in turn be found to be made from still smaller particles? This is certainlypossible, but we do have some theoretical reasons for believing that we have, or are very near to, a knowledge of theultimate building blocks of nature.Using the wave/particle duality discussed in the last chapter, every-thing in the universe, including light and gravity, canbe described in terms of particles. These particles have a property called spin. One way of thinking of spin is to imaginethe particles as little tops spinning about an axis. However, this can be misleading, because quantum mechanics tells usthat the particles do not have any well-defined axis. What the spin of a particle really tells us is what the particle looks likefrom different directions. A particle of spin 0 is like a dot: it looks the same from every direction Figure 5:1-i . On the other\\nhand, a particle of spin 1 is like an arrow: it looks different from different directions Figure 5:1-ii . Only if one turns it round\\na complete revolution (360 degrees) does the particle look the same. A particle of spin 2 is like a double-headed arrowFigure 5:1-iii : it looks the same if one turns it round half a revolution (180 degrees). Similarly, higher spin particles look\\nthe same if one turns them through smaller fractions of a complete revolution. All this seems fairly straightforward, but theremark-able fact is that there are particles that do not look the same if one turns them through just one revolution: youhave to turn them through two complete revolutions!

This was discovered in 1925 by an Austrian physicist,Wolfgang Pauli – for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1945. He was the archetypal theoretical physicist: it was saidof him that even his presence in the same town would make experiments go wrong! Pauli’s exclusion principle says thattwo similar particles can-not exist in the same state; that is, they cannot have both the same position and the samevelocity, within the limits given by the uncertainty principle. The exclusion principle is crucial because it explains whymatter particles do not collapse to a state of very high density under the influence of the forces produced by the particlesof spin 0, 1, and 2: if the matter particles have very nearly the same positions, they must have different velocities, whichmeans that they will not stay in the same position for long. If the world had been created without the exclusion principle,quarks would not form separate, well-defined protons and neutrons. Nor would these, together with electrons, formseparate, well-defined atoms. They would all collapse to form a roughly uniform, dense “soup.”A proper understanding of the electron and other spin-½ particles did not come until 1928, when a theory was proposedby Paul Dirac, who later was elected to the Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at Cambridge (the sameprofessorship that Newton had once held and that I now hold). Dirac’s theory was the first of its kind that was consistentwith both quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity. It explained mathematically why the electron hadspin-½; that is, why it didn’t look the same if you turned it through only one complete revolution, but did if you turned itthrough two revolutions. It also predicted that the electron should have a partner: an anti-electron, or positron. Thediscovery of the positron in 1932 confirmed Dirac’s theory and led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in1933. We now know that every particle has an antiparticle, with which it can annihilate. (In the case of the force-carryingparticles, the antiparticles are the same as the particles themselves.) There could be whole antiworlds and antipeoplemade out of antiparticles. However, if you meet your antiself, don’t shake hands! You would both vanish in a great flashof light. The question of why there seem to be so many more particles than antiparticles around us is extremelyA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

       " {'input': Document(page_content='proposed theories that unified this interaction with the electromagnetic force, just as Maxwell had unified electricity andmagnetism about a hundred years earlier. They suggested that in addition to the photon, there were three other spin-1particles, known collectively as massive vector bosons, that carried the weak force. These were called W\\n+ (pronounced\\nW plus), W- (pronounced W minus), and Zº (pronounced Z naught), and each had a mass of around 100 GeV (GeV\\nstands for gigaelectron-volt, or one thousand million electron volts). The Weinberg-Salam theory exhibits a propertyknown as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This means that what appear to be a number of completely different particlesat low energies are in fact found to be all the same type of particle, only in different states. At high energies all theseparticles behave similarly. The effect is rather like the behavior of a roulette ball on a roulette wheel. At high energies(when the wheel is spun quickly) the ball behaves in essentially only one way – it rolls round and round. But as the wheelslows, the energy of the ball decreases, and eventually the ball drops into one of the thirty-seven slots in the wheel. Inother words, at low energies there are thirty-seven different states in which the ball can exist. If, for some reason, wecould only observe the ball at low energies, we would then think that there were thirty-seven different types of ball!In the Weinberg-Salam theory, at energies much greater than 100 GeV, the three new particles and the photon would allbehave in a similar manner. But at the lower particle energies that occur in most normal situations, this symmetrybetween the particles would be broken. WE, W, and Zº would acquire large masses, making the forces they carry have avery short range. At the time that Salam and Weinberg proposed their theory, few people believed them, and particleaccelerators were not powerful enough to reach the energies of 100 GeV required to produce real W\\n+, W-, or Zº particles.\\nHowever, over the next ten years or so, the other predictions of the theory at lower energies agreed so well withexperiment that, in 1979, Salam and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, together with SheldonGlashow, also at Harvard, who had suggested similar unified theories of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces.The Nobel committee was spared the embarrassment of having made a mistake by the discovery in 1983 at CERN(European Centre for Nuclear Research) of the three massive partners of the photon, with the correct predicted massesand other properties. Carlo Rubbia, who led the team of several hundred physicists that made the discovery, received theNobel Prize in 1984, along with Simon van der Meer, the CERNengineer who developed the antimatter storage systememployed. (It is very difficult to make a mark in experimental physics these days unless you are already at the top! )The fourth category is the strong nuclear force, which holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron, and holds theprotons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. It is believed that this force is carried by another spin-1 particle,called the gluon, which interacts only with itself and with the quarks. The strong nuclear force has a curious propertycalled confinement: it always binds particles together into combinations that have no color. One cannot have a singlequark on its own because it would have a color (red, green, or blue). Instead, a red quark has to be joined to a green anda blue quark by a “string” of gluons (red + green + blue = white). Such a triplet constitutes a proton or a neutron. Anotherpossibility is a pair consisting of a quark and an antiquark (red + antired, or green + antigreen, or blue + antiblue = white).Such combinations make up the particles known as mesons, which are unstable because the quark and antiquark canannihilate each other, producing electrons and other particles. Similarly, confinement prevents one having a single gluonon its own, because gluons also have color. Instead, one has to have a collection of gluons whose colors add up to white.Such a collection forms an unstable particle called a glueball.The fact that confinement prevents one from observing an isolated quark or gluon might seem to make the whole notionof quarks and gluons as particles somewhat metaphysical. However, there is another property of the strong nuclearforce, called asymptotic freedom, that makes the concept of quarks and gluons well defined. At normal energies, thestrong nuclear force is indeed strong, and it binds the quarks tightly together. However, experiments with large particleaccelerators indicate that at high energies the strong force becomes much weaker, and the quarks and gluons behavealmost like free particles.A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

       " {'input': Document(page_content='Figure 5:2\\nFigure 5:2  shows a photograph of a collision between a high-energy proton and antiproton. The success of the unification\\nof the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces led to a number of attempts to combine these two forces with the strongnuclear force into what is called a grand unified theory (or GUT). This title is rather an exaggeration: the resultant theoriesare not all that grand, nor are they fully unified, as they do not include gravity. Nor are they really complete theories,because they contain a number of parameters whose values cannot be predicted from the theory but have to be chosento fit in with experiment. Nevertheless, they may be a step toward a complete, fully unified theory. The basic idea ofGUTs is as follows: as was mentioned above, the strong nuclear force gets weaker at high energies. On the other hand,the electromagnetic and weak forces, which are not asymptotically free, get stronger at high energies. At some very highenergy, called the grand unification energy, these three forces would all have the same strength and so could just bedifferent aspects of a single force. The GUTs also predict that at this energy the different spin-½ matter particles, likequarks and electrons, would also all be essentially the same, thus achieving another unification.The value of the grand unification energy is not very well known, but it would probably have to be at least a thousandmillion million GeV. The present generation of particle accelerators can collide particles at energies of about one hundredGeV, and machines are planned that would raise this to a few thousand GeV. But a machine that was powerful enough toaccelerate particles to the grand unification energy would have to be as big as the Solar System – and would be unlikelyto be funded in the present economic climate. Thus it is impossible to test grand unified theories directly in the laboratory.However, just as in the case of the electromagnetic and weak unified theory, there are low-energy consequences of thetheory that can be tested.The most interesting of these is the prediction that protons, which make up much of the mass of ordinary matter, canspontaneously decay into lighter particles such as antielectrons. The reason this is possible is that at the grandunification energy there is no essential difference between a quark and an antielectron. The three quarks inside a protonnormally do not have enough energy to change into antielectrons, but very occasionally one of them may acquireA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

In other words, the universe would have to behave the same if one replaced particlesby antiparticles, took the mirror image, and also reversed the direction of time. But Cronin and Fitch showed that if onereplaces particles by antiparticles and takes the mirror image, but does not reverse the direction of time, then theuniverse does not behave the same. The laws of physics, therefore, must change if one reverses the direction of time –\\nthey do not obey the symmetry T.Certainly the early universe does not obey the symmetry T: as time runs forward the universe expands – if it ranbackward, the universe would be contracting. And since there are forces that do not obey the symmetry T, it follows thatas the universe expands, these forces could cause more antielectrons to turn into quarks than electrons into antiquarks.Then, as the universe expanded and cooled, the antiquarks would annihilate with the quarks, but since there would bemore quarks than antiquarks, a small excess of quarks would remain. It is these that make up the matter we see todayand out of which we ourselves are made. Thus our very existence could be regarded as a confirmation of grand unifiedtheories, though a qualitative one only; the uncertainties are such that one cannot predict the numbers of quarks that willbe left after the annihilation, or even whether it would be quarks or antiquarks that would remain. (Had it been an excessof antiquarks, however, we would simply have named antiquarks quarks, and quarks antiquarks.)Grand unified theories do not include the force of gravity. This does not matter too much, because gravity is such a weakforce that its effects can usually be neglected when we are dealing with elementary particles or atoms. However, the factthat it is both long range and always attractive means that its effects all add up. So for a sufficiently large number ofmatter particles, gravitational forces can dominate over all other forces. This is why it is gravity that determines theevolution of the universe. Even for objects the size of stars, the attractive force of gravity can win over all the other forcesand cause the star to collapse. My work in the 1970s focused on the black holes that can result from such stellar collapseand the intense gravitational fields around them. It was this that led to the first hints of how the theories of quantummechanics and general relativity might affect each other – a glimpse of the shape of a quantum theory of gravity yet tocome.\\n\\xa0\\nPREVIOUS NEXT\\n\\xa0\\xa0A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

       " {'input': Document(page_content='Figure 6:1\\nAccording to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than light. Thus if light cannot escape, neither can anythingelse; everything is dragged back by the gravitational field. So one has a set of events, a region of space-time, fromwhich it is not possible to escape to reach a distant observer. This region is what we now call a black hole. Its boundaryis called the event horizon and it coincides with the paths of light rays that just fail to escape from the black hole.In order to understand what you would see if you were watching a star collapse to form a black hole, one has toremember that in the theory of relativity there is no absolute time. Each observer has his own measure of time. The timefor someone on a star will be different from that for someone at a distance, because of the gravitational field of the star.A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...

The law of universal gravitation states that every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
