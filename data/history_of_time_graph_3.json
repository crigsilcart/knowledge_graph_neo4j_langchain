That was done by Carl Sagan. Instead,\nI wrote a short piece titled \u201cAcknowledgments\u201d in which I was advised to thank everyone. Some of thefoundations that had given me support weren\u2019t too pleased to have been mentioned, however, because it led toa great increase in applications.I don\u2019t think anyone, my publishers, my agent, or myself, expected the book to do anything like as well as it did.It was in the London Sunday Times best-seller list for 237 weeks, longer than any other book (apparently, the\nBible and Shakespeare aren\u2019t counted). It has been translated into something like forty languages and has soldabout one copy for every 750 men, women, and children in the world. As Nathan Myhrvold of Microsoft (aformer post-doc of mine) remarked: I have sold more books on physics than Madonna has on sex.The success of A Brief History indicates that there is widespread interest in the big questions like: Where did\nwe come from? And why is the universe the way it is?I have taken the opportunity to update the book and include new theoretical and observational results obtainedsince the book was first published (on April Fools\u2019 Day, 1988). I have included a new chapter on wormholesand time travel. Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity seems to offer the possibility that we could create andmaintain wormholes, little tubes that connect different regions of space-time. If so, we might be able to usethem for rapid travel around the galaxy or travel back in time.

These correspondences are a strong indication that there is a completeunified theory of physics, but they also suggest that it may not be possible to express this theory in a singlefundamental formulation. Instead, we may have to use different reflections of the underlying theory in differentsituations. It might be like our being unable to represent the surface of the earth on a single map and having touse different maps in different regions. This would be a revolution in our view of the unification of the laws ofscience but it would not change the most important point: that the universe is governed by a set of rational lawsthat we can discover and understand.On the observational side, by far the most important development has been the measurement of fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background radiation by COBE (the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite) and othercollaborations. These fluctuations are the finger-prints of creation, tiny initial irregularities in the otherwisesmooth and uniform early universe that later grew into galaxies, stars, and all the structures we see around us.Their form agrees with the predictions of the proposal that the universe has no boundaries or edges in theimaginary time direction; but further observations will be necessary to distinguish this proposal from otherpossible explanations for the fluctuations in the background. However, within a few years we should knowwhether we can believe that we live in a universe that is completely self-contained and without beginning orend.Stephen Hawking\n\u00a0A Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking\nfile:///C|/WINDOWS/Desktop/blahh/Stephen Hawking - A brief history of time/A Brief History in Time.html (2 of 2) [2/20/2001 3:13:58 AM]", "metadata": {"source": "../A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes.pdf", "page": 1}, "type": "Document"}}, {"nodes": [{"id": "Ptolemy", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Ptolemy"}}, {"id": "Nicholas Copernicus", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Nicholas Copernicus"}}, {"id": "Sun", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "sun"}}, {"id": "Earth", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "earth"}}, {"id": "Moon", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "moon"}}], "relationships": [{"source": {"id": "Ptolemy", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Ptolemy"}}, "target": {"id": "Sun", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Sun"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}, {"source": {"id": "Ptolemy", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Ptolemy"}}, "target": {"id": "Earth", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Earth"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}, {"source": {"id": "Ptolemy", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Ptolemy"}}, "target": {"id": "Moon", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Moon"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}, {"source": {"id": "Nicholas Copernicus", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Nicholas Copernicus"}}, "target": {"id": "Sun", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Sun"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}, {"source": {"id": "Nicholas Copernicus", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Nicholas Copernicus"}}, "target": {"id": "Earth", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Earth"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}, {"source": {"id": "Nicholas Copernicus", "type": "Person", "properties": {"name": "Nicholas Copernicus"}}, "target": {"id": "Moon", "type": "Celestial body", "properties": {"name": "Moon"}}, "type": "proposed model", "properties": {}}], "source": {"page_content": "Figure 1:1\nThe planets themselves moved on smaller circles attached to their respective spheres in order to account fortheir rather complicated observed paths in the sky.

Whatlay beyond the last sphere was never made very clear, but it certainly was not part of mankind\u2019s observableuniverse.Ptolemy\u2019s model provided a reasonably accurate system for predicting the positions of heavenly bodies in thesky. But in order to predict these positions correctly, Ptolemy had to make an assumption that the moonfollowed a path that sometimes brought it twice as close to the earth as at other times. And that meant that themoon ought sometimes to appear twice as big as at other times! Ptolemy recognized this flaw, but neverthelesshis model was generally, although not universally, accepted. It was adopted by the Christian church as thepicture of the universe that was in accordance with Scripture, for it had the great advantage that it left lots ofroom outside the sphere of fixed stars for heaven and hell.A simpler model, however, was proposed in 1514 by a Polish priest, Nicholas Copernicus. (At first, perhaps forfear of being branded a heretic by his church, Copernicus circulated his model anonymously.) His idea was thatthe sun was stationary at the center and that the earth and the planets moved in circular orbits around the sun.Nearly a century passed before this idea was taken seriously.

This did not significantly affect their predictions of themotions of the planets, but it allowed an infinite distribution of stars to remain in equilibrium \u2013 with the attractiveforces between nearby stars balanced by the repulsive forces from those that were farther away. However, wenow believe such an equilibrium would be unstable: if the stars in some region got only slightly nearer eachother, the attractive forces between them would become stronger and dominate over the repulsive forces sothat the stars would continue to fall toward each other. On the other hand, if the stars got a bit farther awayfrom each other, the repulsive forces would dominate and drive them farther apart.Another objection to an infinite static universe is normally ascribed to the German philosopher Heinrich Olbers,who wrote about this theory in 1823. In fact, various contemporaries of Newton had raised the problem, and theOlbers article was not even the first to contain plausible arguments against it. It was, however, the first to bewidely noted. The difficulty is that in an infinite static universe nearly every line of sight would end on thesurface of a star. Thus one would expect that the whole sky would be as bright as the sun, even at night.Olbers\u2019 counter-argument was that the light from distant stars would be dimmed by absorption by interveningmatter. However, if that happened the intervening matter would eventually heat up until it glowed as brightly asthe stars. The only way of avoiding the conclusion that the whole of the night sky should be as bright as thesurface of the sun would be to assume that the stars had not been shining forever but had turned on at somefinite time in the past. In that case the absorbing matter might not have heated up yet or the light from distantstars might not yet have reached us. And that brings us to the question of what could have caused the stars tohave turned on in the first place.The beginning of the universe had, of course, been discussed long before this. According to a number of earlycosmologies and the Jewish/Christian/Muslim tradition, the universe started at a finite, and not very distant,time in the past. One argument for such a beginning was the feeling that it was necessary to have \u201cFirst Cause\u201dto explain the existence of the universe. (Within the universe, you always explained one event as being causedby some earlier event, but the existence of the universe itself could be explained in this way only if it had somebeginning.) Another argument was put forward by St. Augustine in his book The City of God. He pointed out\nthat civilization is progressing and we remember who performed this deed or developed that technique. Thusman, and so also perhaps the universe, could not have been around all that long. St. Augustine accepted adate of about 5000 BC for the Creation of the universe according to the book of Genesis. (It is interesting thatthis is not so far from the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 BC, which is when archaeologists tell us thatcivilization really began.)Aristotle, and most of the other Greek philosophers, on the other hand, did not like the idea of a creationbecause it smacked too much of divine intervention. They believed, therefore, that the human race and theworld around it had existed, and would exist, forever. The ancients had already considered the argument aboutprogress described above, and answered it by saying that there had been periodic floods or other disasters thatrepeatedly set the human race right back to the beginning of civilization.The questions of whether the universe had a beginning in time and whether it is limited in space were laterextensively examined by the philosopher Immanuel Kant in his monumental (and very obscure) work Critique of\nPure Reason, published in 1781. He called these questions antinomies (that is, contradictions) of pure reason\nbecause he felt that there were equally compelling arguments for believing the thesis, that the universe had abeginning, and the antithesis, that it had existed forever. His argument for the thesis was that if the universe didnot have a beginning, there would be an infinite period of time before any event, which he considered absurd.The argument for the antithesis was that if the universe had a beginning, there would be an infinite period oftime before it, so why should the universe begin at any one particular time? In fact, his cases for both the thesisand the antithesis are really the same argument. They are both based on his unspoken assumption that timecontinues back forever, whether or not the universe had existed forever. As we shall see, the concept of timehas no meaning before the beginning of the universe. This was first pointed out by St. Augustine. When asked:\u201cWhat did God do before he created the universe?\u201d Augustine didn\u2019t reply: \u201cHe was preparing Hell for peoplewho asked such questions.\u201d Instead, he said that time was a property of the universe that God created, andthat time did not exist before the beginning of the universe.When most people believed in an essentially static and unchanging universe, the question of whether or not ithad a beginning was really one of metaphysics or theology.

But in 1929, Edwin Hubble made thelandmark observation that wherever you look, distant galaxies are moving rapidly away from us. In other words,the universe is expanding. This means that at earlier times objects would have been closer together. In fact, itseemed that there was a time, about ten or twenty thousand million years ago, when they were all at exactlythe same place and when, therefore, the density of the universe was infinite. This discovery finally brought thequestion of the beginning of the universe into the realm of science.Hubble\u2019s observations suggested that there was a time, called the big bang, when the universe wasinfinitesimally small and infinitely dense. Under such conditions all the laws of science, and therefore all abilityto predict the future, would break down. If there were events earlier than this time, then they could not affectwhat happens at the present time. Their existence can be ignored because it would have no observationalconsequences. One may say that time had a beginning at the big bang, in the sense that earlier times simplywould not be defined. It should be emphasized that this beginning in time is very different from those that hadbeen considered previously. In an unchanging universe a beginning in time is something that has to beimposed by some being outside the universe; there is no physical necessity for a beginning. One can imaginethat God created the universe at literally any time in the past. On the other hand, if the universe is expanding,there may be physical reasons why there had to be a beginning. One could still imagine that God created theuniverse at the instant of the big bang, or even afterwards in just such a way as to make it look as though therehad been a big bang, but it would be meaningless to suppose that it was created before the big bang. Anexpanding universe does not preclude a creator, but it does place limits on when he might have carried out hisjob!In order to talk about the nature of the universe and to discuss questions such as whether it has a beginning oran end, you have to be clear about what a scientific theory is. I shall take the simpleminded view that a theoryis just a model of the universe, or a restricted part of it, and a set of rules that relate quantities in the model toobservations that we make. It exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality (whatever that mightmean). A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements. It must accurately describe a large class ofobservations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definitepredictions about the results of future observations. For example, Aristotle believed Empedocles\u2019s theory thateverything was made out of four elements, earth, air, fire, and water. This was simple enough, but did not makeany definite predictions. On the other hand, Newton\u2019s theory of gravity was based on an even simpler model, inwhich bodies attracted each other with a force that was proportional to a quantity called their mass andinversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Yet it predicts the motions of the sun, themoon, and the planets to a high degree of accuracy.Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it. Nomatter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the nexttime the result will not contradict the theory. On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even asingle observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory. As philosopher of science Karl Popper hasemphasized, a good theory is characterized by the fact that it makes a number of predictions that could inprinciple be disproved or falsified by observation. Each time new experiments are observed to agree with thepredictions the theory survives, and our confidence in it is increased; but if ever a new observation is found todisagree, we have to abandon or modify the theory.At least that is what is supposed to happen, but you can always question the competence of the person whocarried out the observation.In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory.For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motionand the predictions of Newton\u2019s theory of gravity. Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity predicted a slightlydifferent motion from Newton\u2019s theory. The fact that Einstein\u2019s predictions matched what was seen, whileNewton\u2019s did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory. However, we still use Newton\u2019s theoryfor all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is verysmall in the situations that we normally deal with.

Before them people believedAristotle, who said that the natural state of a body was to be at rest and that it moved only if driven by a force orimpulse. It followed that a heavy body should fall faster than a light one, because it would have a greater pulltoward the earth.The Aristotelian tradition also held that one could work out all the laws that govern the universe by purethought: it was not necessary to check by observation. So no one until Galileo bothered to see whether bodiesof different weight did in fact fall at different speeds. It is said that Galileo demonstrated that Aristotle\u2019s beliefwas false by dropping weights from the leaning tower of Pisa. The story is almost certainly untrue, but Galileodid do something equivalent: he rolled balls of different weights down a smooth slope. The situation is similar tothat of heavy bodies falling vertically, but it is easier to observe because the Speeds are smaller. Galileo\u2019smeasurements indicated that each body increased its speed at the same rate, no matter what its weight. Forexample, if you let go of a ball on a slope that drops by one meter for every ten meters you go along, the ballwill be traveling down the slope at a speed of about one meter per second after one second, two meters persecond after two seconds, and so on, however heavy the ball. Of course a lead weight would fall faster than afeather, but that is only because a feather is slowed down by air resistance. If one drops two bodies that don\u2019thave much air resistance, such as two different lead weights, they fall at the same rate. On the moon, wherethere is no air to slow things down, the astronaut David R. Scott performed the feather and lead weightexperiment and found that indeed they did hit the ground at the same time.Galileo\u2019s measurements were used by Newton as the basis of his laws of motion. In Galileo\u2019s experiments, as abody rolled down the slope it was always acted on by the same force (its weight), and the effect was to make itconstantly speed up. This showed that the real effect of a force is always to change the speed of a body, ratherthan just to set it moving, as was previously thought. It also meant that whenever a body is not acted on by anyforce, it will keep on moving in a straight line at the same speed. This idea was first stated explicitly in Newton\u2019sPrincipia Mathematica, published in 1687, and is known as Newton\u2019s first law. What happens to a body when a\nforce does act on it is given by Newton\u2019s second law. This states that the body will accelerate, or change itsspeed, at a rate that is proportional to the force. (For example, the acceleration is twice as great if the force istwice as great.) The acceleration is also smaller the greater the mass (or quantity of matter) of the body. (Thesame force acting on a body of twice the mass will produce half the acceleration.) A familiar example isprovided by a car: the more powerful the engine, the greater the acceleration, but the heavier the car, thesmaller the acceleration for the same engine. In addition to his laws of motion, Newton discovered a law todescribe the force of gravity, which states that every body attracts every other body with a force that isproportional to the mass of each body. Thus the force between two bodies would be twice as strong if one ofthe bodies (say, body A) had its mass doubled. This is what you might expect because one could think of thenew body A as being made of two bodies with the original mass. Each would attract body B with the original\nforce. Thus the total force between A and B would be twice the original force. And if, say, one of the bodies had\ntwice the mass, and the other had three times the mass, then the force would be six times as strong. One cannow see why all bodies fall at the same rate: a body of twice the weight will have twice the force of gravitypulling it down, but it will also have twice the mass. According to Newton\u2019s second law, these two effects willexactly cancel each other, so the acceleration will be the same in all cases.Newton\u2019s law of gravity also tells us that the farther apart the bodies, the smaller the force. Newton\u2019s law ofgravity says that the gravitational attraction of a star is exactly one quarter that of a similar star at half thedistance. This law predicts the orbits of the earth, the moon, and the planets with great accuracy. If the lawwere that the gravitational attraction of a star went down faster or increased more rapidly with distance, theorbits of the planets would not be elliptical, they would either spiral in to the sun or escape from the sun.The big difference between the ideas of Aristotle and those of Galileo and Newton is that Aristotle believed in apreferred state of rest, which any body would take up if it were not driven by some force Or impulse. Inparticular, he thought that the earth was at rest. But it follows from Newton\u2019s laws that there is no uniqueA Brief History of Time - Stephen Hawking...
